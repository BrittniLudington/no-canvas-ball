# No Canvas Ball

Experiment in HTML and Javascript. Create an object that can be moved freely on the DOM, not a canvas.

## To Download

- Since it imports a Javascript file, a localhost must be used.

## To use
An object will appear on the webpage. Use the cursor to grab it and drag it to any desired location.

## Things that would be nice to implement
- Gravity that can be turned on and off.
- Collision detection between cursor and object that can be turned on and off.

## Contents

### index.html

- Inside the body is a div, this div is the interactable object.
